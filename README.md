## bash completion for the Munki command line tools

These are a number of scripts designed to add programmable completion to `bash` for all
the command line tools used by Munki.

They complete the commands and the long options for each command. For
the options the completion cuts in once you type `--`.

If you have installed bash completion using `brew` then drop the file
into `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/` and open a new Terminal window.
